Big.js
An Arbitrary Precision Math Library for JavaScript

==Overview==

Big.js provides a class definition (Big) to handle numbers of any precision and
perform mathematical operations on them within JavaScript. Create a "Big" 
object in either of the the following ways:

    new Big("123.456"); // --> [Object]

OR:

    Big.parse("567.890"); // --> [Object]

==Method Support==

Version 0.7.*:
    lessThan, lessThanOrEqualTo, greaterThan, greaterThanOrEqualTo, equals

Version 0.8.*:
    plus, minus, negate, clone

==Runing Unit Tests==

The unit test suite is a stratified-randomized differential tester which runs
in UNIX environments and is designed for the VT100 shell (for colors). It has
a small list of system requirements.

    1)  Mozilla's Rhino Shell: This is available from Mozilla for free. It is
        essentially a JavaScript interpreter/shell environment which we use to 
        execute the library code quickly and programmatically (and without a 
        browser).

    2)  The "bc" UNIX utility. This ships standard with most UNIX's. It is a 
        programming language built around an infinite precision math library
        used here as an "oracle" for the differential testing.

To run the unit tests, execute the shell script:

    ./run.tests.sh
